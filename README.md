n large industrial campuses, shopping malls or hospitals Big Data Projects

Project 1 - Customer Brand Preference (Classification & Multiple Regression & Market Basket Analysis)
Datasets:
1. 10,000 completed surveys
    5,000 incompleted surveys
   Survey Information: Salary, Age, Education Level, Car, Zipcode, Credit, and Computer Brand Preference(Acer Vs. Sony)
   
2. 80 existing products 
   24 new products
   Product information: Product Type, Product Number, Price, Star Reviews, Customer Reviews, Recommend Product, Best Seller, Shipping Weight, Product Dimension, Profit Margin, and Volume 

3. 9835 lines of random electronic transcations in Excel

Project Summary:
1. Use CompleteResponses.csv to train and build the predictive model, and applied the SurveyIncomplete.csv to test my model and to make predictions about customers' brand preferences that are missing from the incompleted surveys
2. Creat dummy variables for this multiple regression task in order to predict the sales in four different product types while assessing the impact of service and customer reviews have on sales
3. Discover the interesting relationships (or associations) between customer’s transactions and the item(s) they’ve purchased. These associations can then be used to drive sales-oriented initiatives such as "frequently bought together" used by Amazon. Further to help the board of directors to better understand the clientele that the company currently intend to acquire and see if it would be an optimal acquisition  


Project 2 - Power Consumption Analysis and Forecasting (Time Series)
Datasets:  UCI achieve stored and secured on AWS
Over two million measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over the period of almost 4 years.   
Data was gathered in a house located in Sceaux, France

Project Summary:
1. Perform an in-depth analysis of the power consumption via data visualization and time series regression 
modeling
2. Work with seasonal forecasting by subsetting the data into meaningful time periods
3. Inspire Smart Home owners, developer and utility company with greater understanding and control of their 
power usage


Project 3 - Indoor Wifi Locationing
Datasets: 19937 observations and 590 attributes 
          Attributes: 520 WAP Detectors and 9 positoining attributes (Longtitue, Latitude, Floor, BuildingID, SpaceID, Relative Position, UserID, PhoneID, Timestamp) 
       
Project Summary:
1. Help people to navigate a complex, unfamiliar interior space without getting lost (i.e. large industrial campuses, shopping malls)
2. How to enhance the signal for existing WAP detectors with Beacon Technology

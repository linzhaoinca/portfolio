# Big Data Projects

## Project 1 - Customer Brand Preference (Classification & Multiple Regression & Market Basket Analysis)

- ### Datasets:
      1. 10,000 completed surveys
          5,000 incompleted surveys
          Survey Information: Salary, Age, Education Level, Car, Zipcode, Credit, and Computer Brand Preference
      2. 80 existing products
         24 new products
         Product information: Product Type, Product Num, Price, Star & Customer Reviews, Dimension, Margin
      3. 9835 lines of random electronic transactions in Excel

- ### Project Summary:

	  1. Use completed surveys to train and build the predictive model, and applied to incompleted surveys
	  for testing and to make predictions on customers' preferences that are missing from the incompleted surveys

	  2. Create dummy variables for this multiple regression task in order to predict the sales in four different
	  product types while assessing the impact of service and customer reviews have on sales

	  3. Discover the interesting relationships between customer’s transactions and the item(s) they’ve purchased.
	  These associations can then be used to drive up sales such as "frequently bought together" used by Amazon.
      Furthermore, it can be used to help the board of directors to better understand the clientele that
      company currently intend to acquire and see if it would be an optimal acquisition

## Project 2 - Power Consumption Analysis and Forecasting (Time Series)

- ### Datasets: UCI achieve stored and secured on AWS
      1. Over two million measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling 
      rate over the period of almost 4 years.
      2. Data was gathered in a house located in Sceaux, France

- ### Project Summary:
      1. Perform an in-depth analysis of the power consumption via data visualization and 
      time series regression modeling
      2. Work with seasonal forecasting by subsetting the data into meaningful time periods
      3. Inspire Smart Home owners, developers and utility company to better understand and 
      control of their power usage

## Project 3 - Indoor Wifi Locationing (Classification)
- ### Datasets:
      1. 19937 observations and 590 attributes
      2. Attributes: 520 WAP Detectors and 9 position-related attributes

- ### Project Summary:
      1. Help people to navigate a complex, unfamiliar interior space without getting lost
      2. How to enhance the signal for existing WAP detectors with Beacon Technology

## Project 4 - Develop Models to Predict Sentiment (Classification)
- ### Datasets:
      1. 12974 observations for Galaxy, 12912 observations for iPhone and a Large matrix of 22460 observations
	  which collected from Common Crawl
      2. Attributes: 59 attributes which represent sentiment reviews for each iPhone and Samsung Galaxy dataset

- ### Project Summary:
      1. Investigate and build predictive models that understand the patterns in the both iPhone and Galaxy
	  and then apply the best winning model to the Large Matrix file to complete the analysis of overall
      sentiment toward both iPhone and Samsung Galaxy
      2. Compare the performance of the classifiers in "out of the box modeling with different
      preprocessed dataset combinations and also try to improve the performance metrics with
      feature selection and feature engineering

## Project 5 - Python Projects 
- ### Datasets:
      1. Contains 30,000 customer default information. 
      2. Attributes: Amount of the given credit, Gender, Education, Marital Status, Age, History of past payments
      Amount of bill statement, Amount of previous payment 

- ### Project Summary:
      1. An increase in the number of customers who have defaulted on loans in Credit One, a credit scoring 
      service, could risk losing business if the problem is not solved right away. 
      2. Thoroughly examined the customer demographical factors, and try to identify which attributes influence 
      the most on customer default rates
      3. Build predictive models to better classify potential “at risk” customers
